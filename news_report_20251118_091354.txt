EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pressing issue of climate change demands immediate attention and action to
prevent catastrophic consequences. With rising global temperatures, warming and
acidifying seas, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events, the United
Nations has warned of a "climate time bomb" that could lead to immense
suffering if left unaddressed. To address this critical issue, various
organizations are working to promote environmental awareness and support
international climate change initiatives. Notably, RTCC, a non-profit
organization, plays a significant role in global environmental discussions as
an official Observer to several key UN conventions and holds Special Advisory
Status with the UN Economic and Social Council. Furthermore, initiatives such
as the World Resources Institute's Climate Change News Hub are providing
credible and science-based information on the evolving climate landscape,
offering data-driven insights to support a more sustainable and equitable
future. By facilitating informed decision-making and driving a just transition,
these efforts aim to reduce humanity's harmful impact on the planet and
mitigate the effects of climate change, ultimately working towards a net-zero
future.
