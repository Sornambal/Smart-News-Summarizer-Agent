│ "politics":                                                                │

│ The US political landscape has seen significant developments in recent     │
│ days. The US Senate has passed a bill to reopen the federal government,    │
│ ending a 42-day shutdown, with a 60-40 vote in favor of the continuing     │
│ resolution. The bill, which funds the government through January, will     │
│ now head to the House of Representatives and is expected to be signed      │
│ into law by President Trump. Meanwhile, educational institutions are       │
│ navigating the implications of federal policy changes, with the            │
│ University of Pennsylvania releasing updates on topics such as federal     │
│ funding, immigration policies, and visa screening. The University of       │
│ Kentucky has also taken action, terminating its contractual relationship   │
│ with the PhD Project amidst a Department of Education review of racial     │
│ preferences and stereotypes in education programs. Additionally,           │
│ international students and scholars are being advised to exercise caution  │
│ when traveling, with the International Student and Scholar Services        │
│ (ISSS) encouraging individuals to stay informed about current travel       │
│ restrictions and policy changes. Overall, these developments highlight     │
│ the complex and evolving nature of US politics and its impact on various   │
│ sectors, including education and immigration.                              │

│     The US Senate has passed a bill to reopen the federal government, ending  │
│     a 42-day shutdown, with a 60-40 vote in favor of the continuing        │
│     resolution. The bill, which funds the government through January, was  │
│     supported by nearly all Republicans and eight Democrat senators. Senate  │
│     Democrats had initially demanded the extension of enhanced Covid-era   │
│     Obamacare subsidies in exchange for reopening the government, but this  │
│     demand was not met, and instead, a separate vote on the subsidies will be  │
│     held in December. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives,  │
│     where it is expected to be voted on and eventually signed into law by  │
│     President Trump.                                                       │
