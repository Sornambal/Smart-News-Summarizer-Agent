EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the world navigates the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial
Intelligence (AI), significant progress has been made in expanding access to
computer science education globally, with the number of countries offering K-12
computer science education doubling since 2019. However, disparities in access
and readiness persist, particularly in many African countries where
infrastructure gaps hinder progress. In the business sector, while most
organizations have begun to experiment with AI, with 88% reporting regular use
in at least one business function, only 39% have achieved enterprise-level
impact. To unlock the full potential of AI, organizations must focus on
strategic integration, redesigning workflows, and adopting key technical and
cultural practices, as outlined in the DORA AI Capabilities Model. Ultimately,
the effective adoption of AI will require addressing existing gaps in education
and infrastructure, as well as a nuanced understanding of how AI can amplify an
organization's strengths and weaknesses, in order to drive meaningful
innovation and improvement.

1. The 2025 AI Index Report

The number of countries offering K-12 computer science education has doubled
since 2019, with significant progress in Africa and Latin America. Despite this
growth, access to computer science education remains limited in many African
countries due to infrastructure gaps such as electricity shortages. In the US,
there has been a 22% increase in computing graduates over the past decade, but
many K-12 teachers feel unprepared to teach AI as part of foundational computer
science education. Overall, while progress has been made, disparities in access
and readiness continue to persist globally.

2. The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation

Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:
Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase of AI
adoption, with nearly two-thirds yet to scale AI across their enterprises.
Despite this, 88% of respondents report regular AI use in at least one business
function, and many are exploring opportunities with AI agents, with 62%
experimenting with them. While AI is enabling innovation and showing positive
leading indicators, only 39% of respondents report enterprise-level EBIT
impact, and redesigning workflows is seen as a key success factor for
high-performing companies. The survey suggests that AI use is broadening, but
progress remains uneven, with most organizations still working to embed AI
deeply into their workflows and processes.

3. State of AI-assisted Software Development 2025

A recent report on AI-assisted software development highlights AI's role as an
amplifier of an organization's existing strengths and weaknesses. The report
emphasizes that the greatest benefits of AI investment come from a strategic
focus on the underlying organizational system, rather than the AI tools
themselves. The introduction of the DORA AI Capabilities Model identifies key
technical and cultural practices that can maximize the positive impacts of AI
on performance. This model provides a framework for organizations to optimize
their AI investments and improve overall software development outcomes.
