**Executive Summary: Accident Reporting and Road Safety Initiatives**

Recent developments highlight the importance of accident reporting and road safety measures. In Illinois, drivers involved in traffic crashes resulting in death, bodily injury, or significant property damage are required to file a report within 10 days, which can be submitted to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This protocol ensures that accidents are documented and investigated, providing valuable insights into the causes of crashes.

Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the Department of Transportation has underscored the need for enhanced road safety, particularly in light of alarming statistics. With over 450 fatalities on Wisconsin roadways in 2025, the state is intensifying efforts to combat reckless driving behaviors, such as speeding and impaired driving, which contributed to 28% and 27% of fatal crashes in 2024, respectively. As part of its strategy to achieve zero preventable deaths, WisDOT is focusing on a multi-faceted approach that combines engineering, education, and enforcement initiatives. By prioritizing road safety and promoting responsible driving practices, these initiatives aim to reduce the number of accidents and save lives.
